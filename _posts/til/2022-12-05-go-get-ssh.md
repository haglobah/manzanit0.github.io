Got something like:

```sh
$ go get github.com/foo/bar@latest
go: downloading github.com/foo/bar v0.21.0
go: downloading github.com/foo/bar v0.0.0-20221202205032-05c20c95981f
go: github.com/foo/bar@latest: github.com/foo/bar@v0.21.0: verifying module: github.com/foo/bar@v0.21.0: reading https://sum.golang.org/lookup/github.com/foo/bar@v0.21.0: 404 Not Found
	server response:

```

This is because you've set up SSH to work with git but `go get` uses HTTPS. the
[recommended link](https://golang.org/doc/faq#git_https) is a good starting
point, but luck has it that you'll probably have to set `GOPRIVATE`. That one I
keep forgetting about, so this is your friendly reminder :)

TLDR;

First:
```
git config â€” global url."ssh://git@github.com/".insteadOf "https://github.com/"
```

Then:
```sh
go env -w GOPRIVATE=github.com/<company>
```
